# The Un-Repairable Tower | GameJamMTL2020
Game submission for Global Game Jam 2020.

A wealthy tycoon purchased the tower cause he got a super good deal on it. Little did he know that he was getting himself a tower that constantly had issues. You play the role of the tycoon's repair drone and are tasked to repair the building. Well... atleast he didn't pick a human to try and fix it. The Un-Repairable tower is a fast paced game that requires quick thinking and reactions to ensure that you fix the tower!
