Hi :)

Thanks to bought this asset :) Here is some informations :

- To use it you need to define the textures pictures to 'readable' under unity.

	Texture Type => Advanced => Read/Write Enabled
	
- Texture are delivered without transparency in the case or you don't want transparency...

	But you can enable it with Texture Type => Alpha From GrayScale

And please, take just one minute of your time to post a review/stars on the store
it's really important for publishers...

Regards
